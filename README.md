# Random Projects
Just a collection of random projects I complete.

This repository is just to store them for easy sharing.

# IMPORTANT NOTE:
DO NOT DIRECTLY COPY ANYTHING YOU SEE ON THIS REPOSITORY

Whether it's for the same project or something else, the repository is meant to be an archive, as well as a tool to get ideas on how to start.
I highly encourage the use of this repository as a starting point, or for an idea of how one person finished the project, but NOT something that should be copied or heavily relied on.
